# fastmcp_server.py
# This script demonstrates how to create a simple MCP server using FastMCP.
# It exposes a single tool that generates a greeting.

# To run this server:
# 1. Make sure you have FastMCP installed: pip install fastmcp
# 2. Save this code as fastmcp_server.py
# 3. Run from your terminal: python fastmcp_server.py

from fastmcp import FastMCP, tool
import asyncio # Required for FastMCP's async capabilities

# Define a simple tool function.
# The `@tool()` decorator registers this Python function as an MCP tool.
# The docstring becomes the tool's description for the LLM.
@tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """
    Generates a personalized greeting.

    Args:
        name: The name of the person to greet.

    Returns:
        A greeting string.
    """
    return f"Hello, {name}! Nice to meet you."

# Initialize the FastMCP server.
# By default, FastMCP runs on http://localhost:8000
# and automatically discovers functions decorated with @tool().
mcp_server = FastMCP()

# To run the server, you typically use `mcp_server.run()` or `mcp_server.run_async()`.
# For a simple script, `run()` is sufficient.
